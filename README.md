## Hi there, this is Mackenzie! 👋

I am a Prof. at EPFL leading a lab that studies adaptive intelligence. What is that? Check out  my prespective piece [here](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2411.15234). My handle reflects some historical use of GitHub before Orgs 👀 where I used to host all lab repos, but now most are under our Org ➡️ [here](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab).

Below is a collection of projects I contribute to, with a few hihglights being:

- 💜 [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut)
- 🦓 [CEBRA](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA)
- 🎻 [AmadeusGPT](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/amadeusgpt)
- 🟠 [CellSeg3D](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CellSeg3D)


Thanks for visiting!
